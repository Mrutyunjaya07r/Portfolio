            My favorite hobby is playing with video games. Ever since I was a little boy 
            I have always loved playing video games with my older brother. Even up until
            today I still play video games by myself and my brother. Playing video games
            helps me to release my stress, also it relaxes me from a hard and long day 
            of school and work. Playing video games helps me to unwind and have a good 
            time. One of my favorite video games from X-Box is HALO. This game is not l
            ike any other game. The X-Box allows the game HALO to have up to four player
            s, which makes the game more intriguing. This game is based on one person is
            trying to find the other and the only way you can win if you find that person 
            first and shoot them, its like hide and seek but instead of tag you shoot. 
            This game is so basic but I love playing it. I also love this game because I
            used to have a similar game like that when I was younger and I used to play 
            it with my older brother. This game brings back good childhood memories and it
            helps me to relax and have a good time whether I am playing alone or with some.
